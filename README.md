# OCR-Segmentation
Simple Segmentaion technique for OCR applications


My approach to OCR segmentation. The notebooks do the following :
1. Image Processing.ipynb - Basic image processing and the main image segmentation using pixel sum projection technique to detect spaces.
2. Top 10% Tangent - Correction of skewed images using <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221472741_A_New_Algorithm_for_Skew_Detection_in_Images_of_Documents">this paper</a>.

Tried my best to implement the algorithm proposed in [2]. It is not perfect, but works to some extent. ðŸ˜…<br>
The notebooks only focussed on segmentation of paragraph to sentences and sentences to words.
